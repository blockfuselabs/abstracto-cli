# abstracto

Abstracto is a command-line tool written in Rust that simplifies and streamlines the process of creating account abstraction contracts in Solidity. Account abstraction enables smart contracts to manage accounts on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for advanced functionalities such as multi-signature wallets, meta-transactions, and custom transaction validation logic.

The primary goal of this tool is to abstract away the complexities involved in setting up and developing account abstraction contracts. By providing a straightforward interface and a set of powerful commands, aacli helps developers focus on the unique aspects of their contracts without getting bogged down by repetitive setup tasks.
